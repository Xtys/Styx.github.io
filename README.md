***Summary***
Initiated 2016. 
Purpose of the project is to mod all exisiting Heroes into Characters from Anime base on the similarity in lore, skills, concept and back story of each characters. like Something you often see in warcraft3 custom maps.

***Results 2016 to 2022: (Total Heroes Dota 2 is around 124)***
Majority (76%) of Mods have been made. Having a small group of modders, most of us are independent, collabs occasionally on some events and releases. Having said that, In 2022 I have only contributed 5% to 10% of works toward making new mods & fixing bugs. There are alot of concepts and plans which dint make it to see the day of light.
As most modder quit or stop their works being too busy irl.

***Process lifespan***
* pre-basic understanding of Valve source engine - Workshop tools
* Uses Autodesk 3ds design 2012, This is where learning of how 3d models are made of like editing mesh, rigging models, making animation etc
* various 3rd party tools like Photoshop, Mangos Model viewer, Mldvis , Matrix Eater ,Blender , Milkshape 3D
* Communication with other modders: sharing ideas, intel and even skillsets are some of the crucial part that lead to our results. Some of them are telented, made their own software and provid to the community. Cosmetic Remover v2.
Others are really kind enough to make a decoder to decode another game with suitable scripts to extarct resources for use. 

Also did set up donation to monetize my works.
Final wish would have been to completely transform the whole game into something else.

Thank you
